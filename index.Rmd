# IPO (Input-Processing-Output) Protocol 0.1 for Reproducible Research

To download the protocol folder structure click [here](https://juancarloscastillo.github.io/ipo/IPO_template/IPO-Project_template.tar.gz).

----

This is a project folder template pretty much based on the **TIER** protocol (Teaching Integrity in Empirical Research). TIER "promotes the integration of principles and practices related to transparency and replicability in the research training of social scientists." (more information in [https://www.projecttier.org/](https://www.projecttier.org/)).

The implementation of reproducibility in this kinds of protocols is based on generating a **self-contained set of files** organized in a project structure that can be shared and executed by anyone. In other words, it must have all you need to run and re-run the analysis.

The **IPO** protocol follows the rationale of TIER, with some innovations:

- attempts a model easy to memorize and related with the analysis workflow (Input-Processing-Output=IPO), where processing refers to preparing and analyzing data.

- adds an "Input" folder, which is has a broader scope containing the original "Data" folder but also other possible inputs, such as external images and bibliography files.

- the Data folder is also simplified, including now only an "Original" and "Processed" structure.

- it modifies the files to .md (Markdown files) instead of .txt, which is a plain text language that can be then converted to other formats such as pdf and/or html (for instance, when using R / Rmarkdown). But, in the core, they are simple txt files with just another extension.


### Files & Folder Structure

To download the protocol folder structure click [here](https://juancarloscastillo.github.io/ipo/IPO_template/IPO-Project_template.tar.gz).

```
├── input: external information such as images, documents, bib files
|   ├── data:
│     ├── proc     : processed data files
│     ├── original : original data files & metadata when available
│   ├── images
│   ├── bib: bilbliography files
│   ├── prereg: pre-register files when available
|
├── processing:
│   - preparation.Rmd
│   - analysis.Rmd
│
├── output: tables, graphs, logs, anything produced by the code
│   ├── graphs
│   ├── tables
|
- README.md : the general introductory file
- paper.md / paper.html / paper.pdf: the paper

```

### Basic principles

- order: work thinking of someone that is not familiar with the project and that should be able to understand it and reproduce it without further instructions. Ot think about yourself in 5 years: will you be able to understand and reproduce this?

- comment the scripts: record the reasons for any decisions briefly

- the preparation script should begin loading the original data and nothing else, and should end saving the data in the processed data folder.



### Notes

- as the R/Rmarkdown environment allows combining text, analysis & outputs, the corresponding folders (processing & output) could sound redundant. This is probably the case for brief analysis and short reports. Nevertheless, when working on a paper/thesis/group project it is certainly advisable to separate inputs, analysis and outputs for the sake of order and reproducibility despite working with Rmarkdown.

- for making the work easier in Rstudio you might want to make the `project` folder a Rproject folder. This will make that the working directory automatically will be referred to the root, besides activating other functions within Rstudio. For this, just go to File->New project->Existing directory, and point to the project folder. This will create a file with .Rproj extension that when clicked it will open Rstudio and the project folder as a root. In this way it avoids generating local individual working directories (the R command `setwd`), which do not facilitates reproducibility.

- besides having one project folder where all information is contained, the technical key for working within this structure is to save and load files located in different places through **relative paths** (RP), which allows connecting different files within the same project folder. For instance, for loading a data file from the `original` folder from the `preparation.Rmd` script:

```
load("../input/data/original/data.csv")
```
  The `../` characters means "one level up" in the folder structure. In this case, taking as a reference a script within the `processing` folder, we need to go up to the `project` or root folder, and from there go down to  `input/data/original/data.csv`

- for saving tables and any output produced in R use the function `sink`. For instance, for a `stargazer` descriptive table from `data`:

```
sink("output/tables/table1.txt")
stargazer(data, )
sink()
```
  The rationale is to tell in which file to save or sink what comes next, and stop saving with `sink()`

  Then, to call the output from the paper.Rmd file:
`<div><object data="output/tables/table1.txt"></object></div>`

- for saving graphs, after producing and viewing the graph:

```
dev.copy(png,"output/graphs/graph1.png",width=600,
      	height=600); dev.off()
```
  Then, to call the graph from the paper.Rmd file:

```
![](output/graphs/graph1.png)
```

### Further work:

- IPO-RGit: maintaining the same basic structure, this version is an upgrade for taking advantage of all the reproducibility, collaboration and publication tools offerede by the Rmarkdown/Github work environments. An example of this wor-in-progress implementation can be seen [here.](https://juancarloscastillo.github.io/merit-scale/)
